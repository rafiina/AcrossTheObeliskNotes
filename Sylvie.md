## Build Ideas

### [[Sight]]
---
- Weapon:
	- [[Scryer Staff]], if possible
	- Any +sight charge weapon
- Ring:
	- [[Fervent Ring]], if possible
	- [[All-Seeing Amulet]]
	- [[Vision Ring]]
- Accessory:
	- [[Spider Queen Eye]] - Guaranteed drop in [[Big Chamber - The Spider Queen (C)]]
- Pet:
	- [[Harley]] -- Corrupted
- Traits:
	- Target Shooting
	- Hawkeye
	- Eternal Bond
- Perks:
	- Poison
		- Shadow Resist reduction if taking Malukah or Zek
		- Mark
		- Sight
			- Sight +3 on second perk
		- 12 stack Vulnerable
- Key cards:
	- [[Scavenge]]
		- Great card to corrupt in act 4.  Benefit is big, failure cost relatively small
	- [[Detection]]
		- Anti-Stealth, Bigger Damage, Lots of Sight, AoE
	- [[Hunter's Mark]]
		- Vanish, Mark
	- [[Vigilance]]
		- Don't buy from shop before completing [[The Aquarfall Marsh]]
		- Three of these will guarantee ~40-50 stacks of poison on turn 1.  Possibly fire and bleed later on, too.
	- No need for any attacks by the end.
	- I focused on vanish for the rest.  Some multi-hit direct attacks might be nice on [[Lord Hanshek]], but less so on [[Archon Nihr]] since he reduces stacks.
- Synergy:
	- [[Malukah]] - Poison reducing darkness means more damage and better heals.
	- [[Zek]] - Same as Malukah
	- Card Draw - Her deck is cheap, so [[Helping Hands]] with small amounts of energize are great
- Notes:
	- Requires a lot of deck modification over the course of the run.  First two acts are harder from lack of [[Spider Queen Eye]] and Hawkeye
	- Build doesn't come together until [[Spider Queen Eye]], so more or less necessitates [[The Aquarfall Marsh]] for Act 2.
